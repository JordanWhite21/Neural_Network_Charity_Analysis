# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
Alphabet Soup is in need of some help analyzing the impact of each donation they received over the past 20 years. We are going to use neural networks to attempt this. After designing and training models we will be able to help Alphabet Soup get the results they are looking for.

## Results
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
The veriable that is considered to be the target was "Is-Successful". 

- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
The following are the fatures of the model:
-- Name
-- Application
-- Type
-- Affiliationi
-- Classification
-- Use_Case
-- Organization
-- income_amt
-- Special_considerations
-- Stats
-- ask_amt

- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
The main variable that should be removed is EIN. 

- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
There were three layers that were used and multiple neurons. 

- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
Yes

- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary
After training the model, the accuracy that we were able to acheve was 78%.
